# Coroutine Presentation

This presentation (and code) was delivered to Austin Web Python User Group on
July 28th, 2016. It's intent was to cover the history of async Python
programming, language evolution from iterators to generators to native
coroutines, and provide example library usage, sample async programs, and
generally attempt to keep fallacies to a minimum.

The code expects Python 3.5.2, even though it demonstrates concepts dating back
to 2.1/2.2.
